- Embedded was removed, bring this back!
- Checksum shouldn't require a RawCopy - you should be able to concatenate multiple fields
- Errors should **always** show the path where the error occured
- Call new library deconstruct
- How could this library work with non-seekable streams?
  - e.g how would a Pointer be implemented?
- support kaitai format
